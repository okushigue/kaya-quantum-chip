Kaya: An Integrated Photonic Quantum Chip for Computing, Communication, and Metrology   

    Kaya is a scalable, CMOS-compatible photonic quantum processor that unifies three pillars of quantum technology on a single chip: (1) Boson Sampling for quantum computational advantage, (2) BB84 Quantum Key Distribution for information-theoretically secure communication, and (3) NOON-state interferometry for Heisenberg-limited quantum metrology. Implemented in low-loss Si₃N₄ or LiNbO₃ platforms, Kaya leverages programmable interferometers, integrated photon-pair sources, and high-efficiency detectors to deliver a fully functional, room-temperature quantum photonic system. Validated through rigorous simulation, Kaya achieves 5.26 bits of sampling entropy, 0% QBER under ideal conditions, and 2× quantum-enhanced phase sensitivity — establishing a robust foundation for real-world quantum applications.
